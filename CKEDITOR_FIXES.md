# CKEditor Fixes - Complete Guide

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Upload Adapter Error** ❌ → ✅
**Error**: `filerepository-no-upload-adapter`

**Problem**: The CKEditor Classic build didn't include the SimpleUpload plugin.

**Solution**: Created a custom upload adapter that integrates with your existing Laravel upload endpoint (`admin.upload.image`).

### 2. **Headings Not Working** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Complex configuration was overriding default heading functionality.

**Solution**: Used CKEditor's default configuration which includes all standard features.

### 3. **Bold Not Working** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Same as headings - configuration conflicts.

**Solution**: Default configuration includes all text formatting features.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Default Configuration
Instead of specifying custom toolbars and options, we now use:
```javascript
ClassicEditor.create(document.querySelector('#content'));
```

This gives us ALL default CKEditor features that are included in the Classic build.

### Custom Upload Adapter
After creating the editor, we inject a custom upload adapter:

```javascript
class CustomUploadAdapter {
    upload() {
        // Uploads image to Laravel backend
        // Returns URL for CKEditor to insert
    }
}
```

This adapter:
1. Takes the file from CKEditor
2. Sends it to your Laravel route: `admin.upload.image`
3. Gets back the URL
4. Tells CKEditor to insert the image

---

## 🚀 Using the Editor

### Adding a Post with Images

1. Go to `/admin/posts/create`
2. Type your content
3. To add an image:
   - Click the image icon in toolbar
   - OR drag & drop an image into the editor
   - OR paste an image from clipboard
4. Wait for upload (shows progress bar)
5. Image appears in editor
6. Save the post normally

### Content is Saved
When you submit the form, the editor content is automatically synced to the hidden textarea, so Laravel receives the HTML content with embedded images.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Editor Doesn't Load
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Check if `/assets/lib/ckeditor5-classic/build/ckeditor.js` loads

### If Headings Don't Work
- Make sure you see "English editor created successfully" in console
- Click the dropdown - should show Paragraph, Heading 1-6

### If Image Upload Fails
Check console for errors. Common issues:
- CSRF token mismatch (refresh page)
- File size too large (max 2MB)
- Storage directory not writable

### If You See Upload Adapter Error
This means the custom adapter didn't register. Check:
- Console shows "✅ Upload adapter added"
- No JavaScript errors before that message
