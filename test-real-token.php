// This is how a REAL Expo push token should look like
// Your current token is "local-only" which means it's not a real token

// Example of what a real token looks like:
$realTokenExample = 'ExponentPushToken[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]';

echo "Your current token: local-only (INVALID)\n";
echo "Real token should look like: $realTokenExample\n\n";

echo "The issue is that your app is not generating a real Expo push token.\n";
echo "This usually happens when:\n";
echo "1. App is running in development mode without proper Expo setup\n";
echo "2. Device doesn't support push notifications (some simulators)\n";
echo "3. Expo project not properly configured for push notifications\n\n";

echo "To fix this, you need to:\n";
echo "1. Make sure you're running a proper development build (not Expo Go)\n";
echo "2. Check that your device supports push notifications\n";
echo "3. Verify your Expo project configuration\n\n";

echo "For now, let's test with a real token format:\n";

// This is what the curl command should look like with a real token:
$curlCommand = 'curl -X POST "https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d \'{
    "to": "ExponentPushToken[YOUR_REAL_TOKEN_HERE]",
    "title": "Test Notification",
    "body": "This is a test notification",
    "data": {"type": "test"}
  }\'';

echo "Curl command (replace YOUR_REAL_TOKEN_HERE with actual token):\n";
echo $curlCommand . "\n\n";

echo "To get a real token, you need to:\n";
echo "1. Rebuild your app with proper Expo configuration\n";
echo "2. Make sure you're on a real device (not simulator)\n";
echo "3. Check the console logs for the actual token generation\n";
