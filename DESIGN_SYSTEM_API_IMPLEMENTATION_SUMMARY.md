## üß™ Testing the API

### Quick Test Commands:

```bash
# Test public endpoints
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/designs"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/designs/search?q=business"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/designs/categories"

# Test authenticated endpoints (replace TOKEN with your bearer token)
TOKEN="your-bearer-token-here"

# Add to favorites
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/designs/1/favorite" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Love this design"}'

# Create collection
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/designs/collections" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Collection", "description": "Test collection"}'

# Get user's favorites
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/designs/favorites" \

```

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

The Design System API seamlessly integrates with the existing Velorena application:

-   **Works with existing Livewire components** (DesignSelector, ShoppingCart, etc.)
-   **Integrates with appointment system** - designs can be linked to appointments
-   **Integrates with order system** - designs can be linked to orders and products
-   **Uses existing authentication** - Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
-   **Follows existing patterns** - Consistent response format and error handling

## üé® User Experience Flow

1. **Browse Designs**: Users can search and browse designs without authentication
2. **Save Favorites**: Authenticated users can favorite designs with notes
3. **Create Collections**: Organize designs into custom collections
4. **Link to Projects**: Connect designs to appointments and orders
5. **Track History**: View all design interactions in one place

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The Design System API is now ready for:

-   ‚úÖ **Frontend Integration** - All endpoints are documented and tested
-   ‚úÖ **Mobile App Integration** - RESTful API with proper authentication
-   ‚úÖ **Third-party Integration** - External API sync functionality
-   ‚úÖ **Scalability** - Proper pagination and database optimization
-   ‚úÖ **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and input validation
