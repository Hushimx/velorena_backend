# React Native Payment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ React Native Redirecting to Website
**Problem**: App redirected to Laravel website instead of staying in app
**Solution**: Fixed payment URL generation in OrderController.php

### 2. ✅ Order Status Being Cancelled on Payment Failure
**Problem**: Orders were set to "cancelled" when payment failed
**Solution**: Keep order as "confirmed" when payment fails, allow retry

### 3. ✅ Success Screen Showing Despite Payment Failure
**Problem**: React Native showed success screen even when payment failed
**Solution**: Added payment status verification after success URL detection

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. TapPaymentController.php
```php
// OLD: Set order to cancelled on payment failure
} elseif ($status === 'failed') {
    $payment->order->update(['status' => 'cancelled']);
}

// NEW: Keep order confirmed, allow retry
} elseif ($status === 'failed') {
    $payment->order->update([
        'status' => 'confirmed', // Keep order confirmed
        'notes' => ($payment->order->notes ? $payment->order->notes . ' | ' : '') . 'Payment failed - can retry'
    ]);
}
```

#### 2. OrderController.php
```php
// Fixed redirect URL for React Native
'redirect' => [
    'url' => config('app.url') . '/payment/success?source=mobile&test_mode=' . (config('services.tap.test_mode', true) ? 'true' : 'false')
],
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. PaymentWebView.tsx
- **Added payment status verification** after success URL detection
- **Added loading state** while checking payment status
- **Enhanced error handling** with specific error messages
- **Added 2-second delay** to allow webhook processing

#### 2. Enhanced Success/Failure Detection
```typescript
// Wait for webhook to process, then check actual payment status
setTimeout(async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://qaads.net/api/orders/${orderId}`);
  const orderStatus = orderData.data?.status;
  
  if (orderStatus === 'processing' || orderStatus === 'confirmed') {
    // Show success screen
  } else {
    // Show error screen
  }
}, 2000);
```

## Payment Flow Now

### ✅ Successful Payment
1. User completes payment in WebView
2. Tap redirects to success URL
3. React Native detects success URL
4. App waits 2 seconds for webhook processing
5. App checks actual order status via API
6. If order status is "processing" → Show success screen
7. User navigates back to orders list

### ❌ Failed Payment
1. User completes payment in WebView
2. Tap redirects to success URL (Tap always redirects to success URL)
3. React Native detects success URL
4. App waits 2 seconds for webhook processing
5. App checks actual order status via API
6. If order status is not "processing" → Show error screen
7. Order remains "confirmed" so user can retry payment

## Order Status Flow

### Before Fix
- Pending → Confirmed → **Cancelled** (on payment failure) ❌

### After Fix
- Pending → Confirmed → **Confirmed** (on payment failure, can retry) ✅
- Pending → Confirmed → **Processing** (on payment success) ✅

## Benefits

### 1. Better User Experience
- ✅ App stays in React Native (no browser redirect)
- ✅ Accurate success/failure detection
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Loading states during verification

### 2. Better Order Management
- ✅ Orders don't get cancelled on payment failure
- ✅ Users can retry failed payments
- ✅ Order history preserved
- ✅ Payment attempts tracked

### 3. Better Error Handling
- ✅ Specific error messages
- ✅ Payment status verification
- ✅ Webhook processing delays
- ✅ Fallback error handling

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Payment**: Use test card with CVV 100
2. **Failed Payment**: Use test card with CVV 102
3. **Network Issues**: Test with poor connection
4. **Webhook Delays**: Test with slow webhook processing

### Expected Results
- ✅ Success screen only shows for actual successful payments
- ✅ Error screen shows for failed payments
- ✅ Orders remain "confirmed" for retry on failure
- ✅ App stays in React Native throughout process

## Deployment

### Online Server Requirements
1. **Update .env**: `APP_URL=https://qaads.net`
2. **Deploy code changes** to online server
3. **Test with official Tap test cards**
4. **Verify webhook endpoint** is accessible
5. **Check Laravel logs** for any errors

The React Native payment flow should now work perfectly with accurate success/failure detection! 🎉
