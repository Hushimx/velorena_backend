# Database Cart System - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Complete Database Cart Implementation

You asked for a proper backend database cart system, and that's exactly what I've implemented! The cart now works entirely in the database, not localStorage.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅

-   **`cart_items` table** created with proper structure
-   **CartItem model** with relationships and price calculation methods
-   **User model** updated with cart relationship

### 2. **Complete Cart API** ✅

-   **GET** `/api/cart/items` - Get user's cart items with designs
-   **POST** `/api/cart/items` - Add item to cart
-   **PUT** `/api/cart/items/{cartItemId}` - Update cart item quantity
-   **DELETE** `/api/cart/items/{cartItemId}` - Remove item from cart
-   **DELETE** `/api/cart/clear` - Clear entire cart
-   **POST** `/api/cart/designs` - Add design to cart item
-   **DELETE** `/api/cart/designs` - Remove design from cart item
-   **PUT** `/api/cart/designs/notes` - Update design notes
-   **GET** `/api/cart/items/{productId}/designs` - Get designs for cart item
-   **POST** `/api/cart/checkout` - Create order from cart

### 3. **Updated Livewire Components** ✅

-   **ShoppingCart component** now works with database
-   **AddToCart component** now works with database
-   **Frontend JavaScript** simplified for database cart

### 4. **Database Cart Features** ✅

-   **Persistent cart** - survives browser refresh, device changes
-   **User-specific carts** - each user has their own cart
-   **Price calculation** - automatic price updates with options
-   **Design attachments** - designs linked to cart items
-   **Order integration** - seamless order creation with design preservation

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### `cart_items` Table

```sql
- id (primary key)
- user_id (foreign key to users)
- product_id (foreign key to products)
- quantity (integer)
- selected_options (JSON - stores selected product options)
- notes (text - user notes for cart item)
- unit_price (decimal - cached unit price)
- total_price (decimal - cached total price)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### Relationships

-   **User** hasMany **CartItems**
-   **CartItem** belongsTo **User** and **Product**
-   **CartItem** hasMany **ProductDesigns** (via product_id)
