## 🏗️ **Architecture for the Future**

### **1. Order Complexity Engine**

```php
class OrderComplexityEngine
{
    public function calculateComplexity(Order $order): int
    {
        $score = 0;

        // Product diversity factor
        $score += $this->calculateProductDiversity($order);

        // Value factor
        $score += $this->calculateValueFactor($order);

        // Timeline factor
        $score += $this->calculateTimelineFactor($order);

        // Customer preference factor
        $score += $this->calculateCustomerPreferenceFactor($order);

        return $score;
    }
}
```

### **2. Smart Order Splitting**

```php
class SmartOrderSplitter
{
    public function shouldSplit(Order $order): bool
    {
        $complexity = $this->complexityEngine->calculateComplexity($order);
        $businessRules = $this->getBusinessRules();

        return $this->evaluateSplitCriteria($complexity, $businessRules);
    }

    public function suggestSplitStrategy(Order $order): array
    {
        // Group products by category, timeline, or value
        // Suggest optimal split points
        // Calculate impact on appointments and delivery
    }
}
```

### **3. Appointment Optimization**

```php
class AppointmentOptimizer
{
    public function optimizeSchedule(Order $order): array
    {
        // Consider order complexity
        // Factor in designer availability
        // Account for customer preferences
        // Optimize for delivery timeline
    }
}
```

## 📊 **Business Rules & Thresholds**

### **Order Complexity Thresholds**

-   **Low (0-10)**: Single appointment, simple consultation
-   **Medium (11-20)**: Multiple appointments or detailed consultation
-   **High (21+)**: Automatic order splitting recommended

### **Splitting Criteria**

-   **Product Diversity**: >3 different product categories
-   **Value Threshold**: >$1000 total order value
-   **Timeline Complexity**: Multiple delivery dates needed
-   **Design Complexity**: >5 different design requirements

### **Appointment Strategy Matrix**

| Complexity | Products | Strategy                       | Appointments |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Low        | 1-2      | Single consultation            | 1            |
| Medium     | 3-5      | Detailed consultation          | 1-2          |
| High       | 6+       | Split + multiple consultations | 2+           |

## 🔄 **Workflow for the Future**

### **1. Product Addition Workflow**

```
Add Product → Analyze Order Complexity → Suggest Action
     ↓
[Complexity < 15] → Add to existing order
     ↓
[Complexity 15-25] → Suggest order splitting
     ↓
[Complexity > 25] → Force order splitting
```

### **2. Appointment Creation Workflow**

```
Select Order → Analyze Complexity → Suggest Strategy
     ↓
[Simple Order] → Single appointment
     ↓
[Complex Order] → Multiple appointments or split
     ↓
[Very Complex] → Order splitting + consultation series
```

### **3. Order Management Workflow**

```
Order Created → Complexity Analysis → Management Strategy
     ↓
[Monitor] → Track complexity changes
     ↓
[Alert] → Notify when splitting needed
     ↓
[Action] → Suggest or auto-split
```
