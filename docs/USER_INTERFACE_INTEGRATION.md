    @livewire('design-selector')
</div>
```

### **Selected Designs Summary**

```php

        </h5>
        <!-- Design cards with notes -->
    </div>
@endif
```

### **Appointment Summary Integration**

```php
<!-- Design Summary in Appointment Summary -->
@if (!empty($selectedDesigns))
    <div class="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-blue-200">
        <h6 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-3">
            Design Inspiration:

                </span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
@endif
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Livewire Component Updates**

The `BookAppointmentWithOrders` component now includes:

```php
// New properties
public $selectedDesigns = [];
public $designNotes = [];

// Design management methods
public function addDesign($designId, $notes = '')
public function removeDesign($designId)
public function updateDesignNotes($designId, $notes)
public function getSelectedDesignsData()
public function getSelectedDesignsCount()

// Design attachment in appointment creation
if (!empty($this->selectedDesigns)) {
    $designData = [];
    foreach ($this->selectedDesigns as $index => $designId) {
        $designData[$designId] = [
            'notes' => $this->designNotes[$designId] ?? '',
            'priority' => $index + 1
        ];
    }
    $appointment->designs()->attach($designData);
}
```
