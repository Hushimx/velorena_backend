# Expo Push Notifications & WhatsApp Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

All requested features have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing.

## What Was Built

### üîî Notifications System

The system now sends **both Expo Push Notifications and WhatsApp messages** when:

#### Order Status Changes
- ‚úÖ Confirmed
- ‚úÖ Processing
- ‚úÖ Shipped
- ‚úÖ Delivered
- ‚úÖ Cancelled

#### Appointment Status Changes
- ‚úÖ Accepted (when designer accepts)
- ‚úÖ Started (when meeting begins)
- ‚úÖ Rejected (when designer rejects)
- ‚úÖ Cancelled (when appointment is cancelled)
- ‚úÖ Completed (when meeting ends)

### üì± Deep Linking

When users tap on a notification, they are automatically redirected to:
- **Orders:** `/orders/[id]` - Shows order details
- **Appointments:** `/appointment/[id]` - Shows appointment details

This works in **all app states**:
- ‚úÖ App in foreground
- ‚úÖ App in background
- ‚úÖ App completely closed (killed)

## Files Created/Modified

1. `qaads/app/Models/ExpoPushToken.php` - Model for storing device push tokens
2. `qaads/app/Services/UnifiedNotificationService.php` - Unified notification service
3. `qaads/EXPO_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation
4. `qaads/test-expo-notifications.php` - Testing script

**Modified Files:**
1. `qaads/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OrderController.php` - Added notification sending on order status change
2. `qaads/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AppointmentController.php` - Added notification sending on appointment status change
3. `qaads/app/Http/Controllers/AppointmentController.php` - Updated designer actions (accept, reject, start, cancel) to send notifications

### Frontend (React Native)

**Modified Files:**
1. `velorena_app/hooks/useHybridNotifications.ts` - Added notification tap handling and deep linking
2. `velorena_app/app/_layout.tsx` - Added handler for notifications when app is opened from killed state

### Notification Content

All notifications are in **Arabic** and include:
- ‚úÖ Clear title and body
- ‚úÖ Relevant information (order number, date, time, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Deep link data for navigation
- ‚úÖ Appropriate emojis

Example:
```json
{
  "title": "ÿ™ŸÖ ÿ™ÿ£ŸÉŸäÿØ ÿ∑ŸÑÿ®ŸÉ",
  "body": "ÿ™ŸÖ ÿ™ÿ£ŸÉŸäÿØ ÿ∑ŸÑÿ®ŸÉ ÿ±ŸÇŸÖ ORD20251001",
  "data": {
    "type": "order",
    "orderId": 5,
    "status": "confirmed",
    "screen": "orders/5"
  }
}
```

## Testing Guide

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Backend - Run migrations (if not already done)
cd qaads
php artisan migrate

# Frontend - Make sure expo is configured
cd velorena_app
# Check app.json has correct projectId
```

### 2. Register Push Token

Open the mobile app. The token will automatically register when:
- App launches for the first time
- User logs in
- App returns to foreground

### 3. Test Order Notifications

1. Open admin panel: `http://your-site.com/admin`
2. Navigate to Orders
3. Select any order
4. Change status (e.g., pending ‚Üí confirmed)
5. Check that:
   - ‚úÖ User receives Expo push notification
   - ‚úÖ User receives WhatsApp message
   - ‚úÖ Tapping notification opens order details

### 4. Test Appointment Notifications

**Accept Appointment:**
1. Login as designer
2. Go to pending appointments
3. Accept an appointment
4. Verify user receives notification

**Start Meeting:**
1. Login as designer
2. Open accepted appointment
3. Click "Start Meeting"
4. Verify user receives notification with meeting link

**Cancel Appointment:**
1. Login as designer
2. Open appointment
3. Cancel with reason
4. Verify user receives cancellation notification

### 5. Test Deep Linking

**Background State:**
1. Open app
2. Press home button (app goes to background)
3. Receive notification
4. Tap notification
5. ‚úÖ App should open to correct screen

**Killed State:**
1. Force close app completely
2. Receive notification
3. Tap notification
4. ‚úÖ App should launch and navigate to correct screen

### 6. Run Test Script

```bash
cd qaads
php test-expo-notifications.php
```

This will check:
- Token registration
- Service availability
- Recent orders/appointments
- Send test notification (optional)

## API Endpoints

- Notification sending (success/failure)
- Error details with stack traces

Check logs at: `qaads/storage/logs/laravel.log`

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Received

**Check:**
1. Token is registered: `SELECT * FROM expo_push_tokens WHERE is_active = 1`
2. User granted permissions in device settings
3. Expo project ID matches in app.json
4. Check Laravel logs for errors

### Deep Linking Not Working

**Check:**
1. Routes exist in app: `/orders/[id]` and `/appointment/[id]`
2. Notification data includes `screen` field
3. `useRouter` is properly imported from `expo-router`

### WhatsApp Not Sending

**Check:**
1. Credentials in `.env`
2. User has phone number in database
3. User has `whatsapp_notifications = true`
4. SmartWats API is accessible
